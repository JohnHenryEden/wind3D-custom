# 3D-Wind-Field
My graduation project

## How to start the application
You just need to create a HTTP server for the index.html file(in the Cesium-3D-Wind folder).

If you have VSCode installed, I recommend to intall the "liveserver" extension and open the 
3D-Wind-Field.code-workspace file in VSCode, then use "liveserver" to create a HTTP server
