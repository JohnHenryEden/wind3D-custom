# 3D-Wind-Field - [Demo](https://RaymanNg.github.io/3D-Wind-Field/demo/)
My graduation project

## How to start the application
Just create a HTTP server for the index.html file(in the Cesium-3D-Wind folder).

If you have VSCode installed, I recommend to intall the "liveserver" extension. 
Open the 3D-Wind-Field.code-workspace file in VSCode, then use "liveserver" to create a HTTP server.

Besides, remember to remove the "runtimeExecutable" option in Cesium-3D-Wind\.vscode\launch.json file before 
starting debug in VSCode

## Rerference
I find a good tutorial about doing custom render in Cesium
