# 3D-Wind-Field - [Demo](https://raymanng.github.io/3D-Wind-Field/demo/)
My graduation project

## How to start the application
Just create a HTTP server for the index.html file(in the Cesium-3D-Wind folder).

If you have VSCode installed, I recommend to intall the "liveserver" extension. 

Besides, remember to modify the "runtimeExecutable" option in .vscode\launch.json file before 
starting debug in VSCode

## Rerference
I find a good tutorial about doing custom render in Cesium
